# Rubik cube - Bun + Three.js + OpenAI Gym

## Introduction

This goal of this project is to build a 3D Rubik's Cube simulator built using Bun, and Three.js.

### Project objectives

- Build backend logic using TypeScript and Bun - WIP.
  - Implement cube state management [x].
  - Implement cube rotation logic [x].
  - Implement cube scramble and reset [x].
